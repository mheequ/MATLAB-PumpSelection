# MATLAB-PumpSelection
MATLAB code for selecting the optimal pump and impeller size based on desired flow rate and head using digitized Pump Iran catalog data.

This MATLAB code is developed to assist in selecting the appropriate pump based on a desired flow rate (Q) and head (H). The code utilizes digitized pump data obtained from one of the Pump Iran company catalogs to:
Recommend the most suitable pump and the corresponding impeller diameter.
Provide the associated efficiency and required power for the selected pump.
This project is a part of the final assignment for the Fluid Mechanics course, instructed by Dr. Baghapour,at Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).
